# DRIVER Framework: AI-Integrated Finance Education

## Finance Expert + AI Leverage + Software Engineering Mindset = Super Hot Candidate

This repository hosts Dr. Cinder Zhang's educational hub featuring the **DRIVER Framework** - a pedagogical approach that prepares finance students for AI-augmented careers through systematic problem-solving and strategic AI collaboration.

### The Problem

Traditional finance education teaches formulas and theories but leaves students unprepared for modern workplaces where:

* AI handles routine calculations
* Strategic thinking becomes the primary human value-add
* Python and data analysis are baseline requirements
* AI collaboration skills determine career trajectories

### The DRIVER Solution

A six-stage learning framework that builds cognitive strength **through** strategic AI integration:

#### The DRIVER Framework

* **D**iscover: Frame financial problems systematically
* **R**epresent: Visualize cash flows and logic before coding
* **I**mplement: Build solutions with Python and AI as thinking partners
* **V**alidate: Verify results using multiple approaches
* **E**volve: Recognize patterns across different contexts
* **R**eflect: Extract transferable principles for future problems

### What Makes DRIVER Different

**Traditional Approach:** Memorize formulas → Apply to textbook problems → Hope it transfers to work

**DRIVER Approach:** Understand problems → Code solutions → Validate with AI → Build transferable thinking patterns

Students learn to:

* Think strategically while leveraging AI tactically
* Implement financial concepts in Python from day one
* Validate AI outputs rather than blindly trust them
* Adapt quickly to new tools and market conditions

```bash
# Navigate to the Slidev directory
cd Slides/DRIVER-Opening-Talk-Slidev

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# The presentation will be available at http://localhost:3030
# Presenter mode: http://localhost:3030/presenter/
