**Sharing Free Resources for Finance Educators Interested in AI Integration**

I've been exploring how to thoughtfully integrate AI into finance education while maintaining rigorous academic standards. This led me to develop the DRIVER framework and three open-source textbooks.

ðŸ“š **Available on GitHub Pages (Free):**
â€¢ DRIVER: Financial Management
â€¢ DRIVER: Financial Modeling  
â€¢ DRIVER: Essentials of Investment

**Key Features:**
âœ… AI integrated as a learning tool throughout
âœ… Hands-on coding exercises alongside traditional concepts
âœ… Built-in validation methods for AI outputs
âœ… Can complement existing curriculum or stand alone

**The DRIVER Framework:** Discover â†’ Represent â†’ Implement â†’ Validate â†’ Evolve â†’ Reflect

This systematic approach helps students develop both financial expertise and the technical skills increasingly valued by employers.

These resources might be helpful for educators who are:
- Looking to prepare students for modern finance careers
- Interested in incorporating practical coding exercises
- Exploring thoughtful AI integration in their courses

I'd love to connect with other educators working on similar challenges. How are you approaching AI in your finance courses?
